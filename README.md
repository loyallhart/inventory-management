# Inventory-Management

## Description
The objective behind building this application was to provide an easy to use tool for IT inventory; to help managers/employees keep track of what items are in/out stock, damaged, and held internal products. The development of this project allowed us to further our knowledge, and hone our skills in frontend and backend implementations. In completing this project we were able to learn more about RESTful API, MySQL/Sequelize ORM, and API keys. We were also able to explore and learn more about using the Bootstrap CSS library.
